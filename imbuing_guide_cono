Step 1: Plan the suit out in a spreadsheet (you take the base resists a piece always rolls and put them in for each piece, and your artifacts resists as well)
Step 2: Using math, account for Exceptional bonus + arms lore bonus for each crafted piece
Step 3: using the UO material bonuses page look at what barbed and horned give each (you'll never use spined)
Step 4: plug the resistances from the horned and barbed in and shift around the exceptional / arms lore bonus so that when enhanced you'll have 70s without imbuing any resistances
step 5: plan the mods you want on each piece in the end, figure out which ones come from imbuing, and which come from reforging.
Step 6: craft basic leather pieces with resists that meet the spreadsheet's parameters, and then reforge the piece for the mods that can only come from reforging. If you don't get them recraft a piece with the exact same resists and try again until you do get it. (repeat this for all crafted pieces)
Step 7: verify that the pieces match your plan
Step 8: powder of fort them to 255/255
Step 9: imbue the mods you want on them that are missing
Step 10: Verify that you're still on track
Step 11: use forged metal of artifacts charge
Step 12: enhance to the planned material
Step 13: use armor refinements if you planned for them
Step 14: insure, and dye
